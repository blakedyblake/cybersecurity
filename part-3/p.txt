    I recently heard about the Lazarus incident where
the government of Bangladesh's money(from their national bank) 
sending program was hacked. Essenentially banks around the world need
to send each other money. So there is a program that 
allows them to do it electronically. 
    A group of hackers, later dubbed Lazarus, hacked 
into these systems and randomly sent the sums of 
money around the globe. They had done this before 
with other countries but it was with Bangladesh where
it was discovered.
    Before Bangladesh could do much about it, they had
already lost 1 billion dollars-- most of their 
economy. The CIA who officially spoke on the matter after
much search believe strongly that it was North Korea who
interfered. 
    After money was sent to various banks, it is believed
that agents 'withdrew from their bank accounts' in North
Korean friendly countries to give the North koreans their 
money.
    The big reason they were able to pull off the hack was
actually timing of different weekends. Bangladesh has friday
Saturday off work normally and most western nations Saturday
Sunday. So banks of different nations wouldn't have talked 
on their employee's days off. So they made money on the chaos.

    Otherwise people would have paid more attention to it.
    I imagine weekend shifts became more important to banks 
after that day
